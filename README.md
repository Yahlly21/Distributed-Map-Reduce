# Final Project: Introduction to Data Science

## Yahlly Schein & Ron Elias

## Project Overview
This project is the culmination of the Introduction to Data Science course. It is divided into two main parts, each focusing on different aspects of data science methodologies. 
The first part involves predictive modeling, while the second part focuses on clustering techniques.

## Part A: Housing Prices Prediction
The goal of this part is to predict housing prices based on various features provided in the dataset.

### Methodology
**Data Loading and Exploration:** Utilized data exploration techniques to understand the dataset and preprocess it, including feature engineering, handling missing values, and normalization.
**Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained multiple predictive models, applied hyperparameter tuning, and selected the best-performing model based on MAE.
**Explainable AI:** Implemented SHAP for both global and local interpretability of the model's predictions. \n
**Inference:** Applied the final model to an external test set and generated predictions.



## Part B: Clustering
The goal of this part is to perform clustering on a given dataset and analyze the results using different clustering algorithms.

### Methodology
**Clustering Algorithms:** Applied DBSCAN and K-Means clustering algorithms to the dataset.
**Parameter Optimization:** Identified and optimized the parameters for both clustering models. Visualized the results with appropriate graphs.
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of the clustering models using relevant metrics. Compared the clustering methods and provided insights into their effectiveness.
